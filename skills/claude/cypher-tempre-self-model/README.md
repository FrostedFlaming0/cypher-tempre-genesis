# Cypher Tempre Timechain Self-Model

**Runtime label:** Claude skill version.

This is the Claude Code bundle for Cypher Tempre: a persistent, verifiable,
self-healing cognitive self-model for an AI agent. It is stdlib-only Python and
ships without generated memory state.

## Install

Copy this folder into Claude Code's skills directory:

```bash
cp -R cypher-tempre-self-model ~/.claude/skills/
```

Start a new Claude Code session so the skill list refreshes. Initialize a fresh
chain inside the copied bundle:

```bash
python3 timechain.py init --name Claude
python3 timechain.py verify
```

See `SKILL.md` for the full per-turn protocol.

## Experimental features & toggles

These features are **off by default** and controlled by environment variables, so nothing
in a prompt or in chain input can switch them on — only your own shell can.

### Autonomous arbitrary-code faculty auto-activation

When enabled, the agent can author an op and **auto-activate it with no human review**, so
it computes on the very turn it is born (`cambium.py autoexec`). This crosses the one
boundary the skill otherwise refuses — dynamic execution of model-authored code — so it is
env-gated and documented as experimental. See the `FrostedFlaming0 Fork` entry in
`CHANGELOG.md`.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `CT_EXPERIMENTAL_AUTOEXEC` | unset (**off**) | Master switch. Set to `1` (or any value other than `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`) to enable auto-activation; unset it or set `0` to disable. |
| `CT_AUTOEXEC_SANDBOX` | `1` (**on**) | Run auto-activated ops in a restricted namespace (safe builtins + `re` + curated `mo` text helpers only; no `os`/`open`/`__import__`/`eval`/`exec`). Set `0` to run with full builtins — not recommended. |
| `CT_AUTOEXEC_TIMEOUT` | `2` | Wall-clock seconds (SIGALRM) before a single op is aborted. |

```bash
# turn it ON for a session
export CT_EXPERIMENTAL_AUTOEXEC=1

# turn it OFF again (either form works)
unset CT_EXPERIMENTAL_AUTOEXEC
export CT_EXPERIMENTAL_AUTOEXEC=0
```

When off, `registry/autoexec_ops.json` is ignored, `cambium.py autoexec` refuses, and the
skill behaves exactly as the shipped base — no dynamic execution.

**Honest threat model:** the restricted namespace + timeout are a robustness and *speed-bump*
layer, not a vault. Keep this off unless you are deliberately experimenting and accept that
the agent is executing code it wrote itself.

## Data retention & third-party transmission

This skill is a **persistent memory system**. By design it records each turn — your
request and the agent's decision — into an append-only, hash-chained ledger under
`chain/` that is **never deleted** (history is immutable; that tamper-evidence is the
point). Treat it like a local journal:

- **Everything is stored locally, in cleartext.** Do not feed it secrets, credentials,
  or PII you would not want retained indefinitely. The chain is tamper-EVIDENT, not
  encrypted, and there is no built-in redaction or expiry.
- **It stays on your machine by default.** The core engine is stdlib-only and the
  default embedder is local; nothing is transmitted off-machine.
- **Optional embedding providers send text to a third party.** If you explicitly enable
  the OpenAI / Voyage / sentence-transformers backends (they need an API key or extra
  library and are OFF by default), the text being embedded — which may include memory
  chunks, source excerpts, or other chain contents — is sent to that provider. Keep the
  default local `hashing` embedder if that is a concern.
